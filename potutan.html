<h1><li>HISTORY</li></h1>
<p>Surigao del Norte Province is a province of the Philippines located in the Caraga region in Mindanao. Its capital is Surigao City. The province consists of two major islands - Siargao Island, and Bucas Grande Island - in the Philippine Sea, and a small region at the northernmost tip of the island of Mindanao. This mainland portion borders Agusan del Norte, and Surigao del Sur to the south.
Surigao del Norte is the second northernmost of the Mindanao provinces and is an important transportation hub between Visayas and Mindanao. Numerous ferries cross the Surigao Strait between Surigao and the island of Leyte carrying vehicles and passengers between Liloan in Southern Leyte and Surigao City.
